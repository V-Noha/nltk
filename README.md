This repository represents the answers that I put together as I went through the NLTK book. I pushed it to GitHub in the hopes that it would be useful for others and also so that I could document the work with the mentor who was helping me learn at the time. With that in mind, please note the following:

This repository is not actively maintained. The NLTK library is constantly changing, as is the NLTK book. So the answers here may be outdated and **might not run as expected**. 

This repository was put together by a student who was learning at the time. So **there may be errors** in the code for entirely unrelated reasons. 

Think of it more as scribbles in a notebook than things etched in stone.
